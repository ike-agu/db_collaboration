## Using SQL
We decided to use SQL, a relational database.

After seeing these set of instructions, we immediately visualised this data in tables.

>Each person has a name, age and number of people in their household
>Each house has an address and an owner
>Each address has a postcode and street address

We noticed how we can join the table data easily.
